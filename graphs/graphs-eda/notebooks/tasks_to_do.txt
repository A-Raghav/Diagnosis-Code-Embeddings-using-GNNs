Tasks to do:
* Compare the jaccard similarity score with the e_ij_intersection for connected nodes (normalise both); check if both follow the same general trend
* how to measure topological distances b/w nodes in graph??
* How to do computations in case of a directed graph?

heterogenous graphs - graphsage...
personalised page rank - better. how?
structural features - leskovec
jump probabilities - 
disease progression


1. Lectures, content, structural features, tools available
2. identify similar problem sets - movielens dataset, ampligraph dataset (similar problems)
3. node embeddings
4. pytorch transformer
